# KEN Labs Working Protocol v0.1

## Principles

Everything should have an output which can be one of below:
* Content (Docs, Images, Video,etc)
* Code

## Meetings
The meeting should use a stable tool for the meeting host, meeting minutes, and action item
Overall meeting rules

Every meeting should have meeting notes which include
* Attendances
* Topic
* Action items
* Need to be followed up in the future
* Every meeting should be as short as possible to avoid time wasting

### Daily stand-up meeting
* Every workday at 10 am in the China time zone
* Sync about general KEN Labs working items

## Coding
Code must follow code convention and commit conversion
* Every commit must create via a pull request
* Every pull request must have at least 1 reviewer and be approved by the reviewer
* We use GitHub for project management (issues, milestones, feature/epic)


## Knowledge Sharing

* Team members must share knowledge at least once a month with each other
* Sharing should be documented and recorded
* Sharing should be open to the public
